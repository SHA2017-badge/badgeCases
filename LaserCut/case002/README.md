##Suggested assembly:


###Backplate:
Just cut Backplate, use m3-6mm screws for the pcb.

###Full:
Cut one of each, use m3-6mm for the pcb and m3-25mm fot the case.
If you have spacers 5-6mm long are good, if you use nuts you need about 12x4 m3 nuts, or you can use lots of rings(unspecified amount).
