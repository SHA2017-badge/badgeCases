This is free BUT If you mind, pleas bring one bottle of cheap filtered lager aka pilsner (I only drink "tasteless" beers) for Burner at Sauna Finland PRKL@SHA2017. 


THIS IS UNTESTED VERSION!
Pleas inform Burner_@freenode if you test this. 


Model does not need supports. Screws are M3 bolts. At each pillar there is place for 3x3x4mm brass insert at behind of cover. If you do not have inserts you can heat pillars and press them to oval.
