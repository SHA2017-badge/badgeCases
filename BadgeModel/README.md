badgeModelSimplistic is a basic model for the badge, including only the main features.
I made it exporting a dxf from eagle's badge files and importing it in FreeCAD. Working with all the features was making the program to struggle so I had to simplify it to make it bearable.


On this folfer you might find different formats for the badge model:


.fcstd - Freecad Project file, use for your freecad design.
.step  - This is a step conversion so you can import the design in your favorite cad software.
.obj   - Mesh design, if you cannot import .step then use this.

There is also 2d files on 2d folder:
.dxf   -2d export from Eagle files
.svg   -Simplified 2d export.
